Is there a way to display contents of your buffer?.... for example ... I want to remind myself what I named something earlier
from Zach Feeser to everyone:    2:08 PM
pamela --> you can use the locals(), globals() and dir() functions to dump what is currenlty in the system
from Zach Feeser to everyone:    2:08 PM
locals() is prob what you want
